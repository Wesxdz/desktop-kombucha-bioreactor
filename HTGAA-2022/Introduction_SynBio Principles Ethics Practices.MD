# **Principles & Practices Assignments**

reflect each week and in the design of your final project

## Principles & Practices

### describe a biological engineering application or tool you want to develop and why

I would like to design and prototype a desktop kombucha bioreactor, starting with a fully open source digital twin of the hardware and software.
The goal of the project is to create a fully automated modest supply of affordable kombucha to drink and SCOBY to turn into clothing, foods, or 3D printer filament.

### describe one or more governance/policy goals related to ensuring that this application or tool contributes to an "ethical" future, like ensuring non-malfeasance (preventing harm). Break big goals down into two or more specific sub-goals

The critical policy implications I see as follows:
* Study of cooperative intelligence in microorganisms
    * Better understanding of origins of biological intelligence
* Misuse of antimicrobial properties of kombucha
    * Effects on public and private water filtration systems
* Safety of long term human consumption of and exposure to SCOBY
    * Especially considering multiple brewing environmental contexts

### describe at least three different potential governance "actions", each presented in four sections

new requirement/rule, or incentive, or technical strategy
academic researchers, companies, federal regulators, law enforcement
analogies to other domains - (3D printing, drones, financial systems)

1. Study or survey on impact of kombucha on gross national happiness
2. Incentive for bioreactor replicators to collaborate to produce safety tutorials and guidelines for experimentation
3. Civic participation from rural citizens/governments on self-reliance and liberation technologies

### Goal
Currently have prototyped in concept https://app.diagrams.net/#G1fgro-QN3PJ8QcDjfcxQGJdoBc_BiO0F_, ordered a few of the parts, and started on the CAD model and exploring FEM in FreeCAD.

### Design
I need to focus on creating a minimum viable automation interface for fermentation and ingredient dispensing. I need access to a 3D printer or 3D printed parts for the structural design. I may need access to CNC milled parts depending on the design (which would significantly raise the cost). I need to order the rest of the parts and keep working on the machine layout and subcomponents.

### Assumptions
Uncertain what container should be used in fermenting stage. Worried about pressure from brew causing explosion in adverse scenarios. Worried about danger of electric shock or fire from electric heating element used to boil water in substrate preparation.

I have assumed the machine can be built for under $200, but it may cost much more money to prototype.

I assume the financial cost of brewing kombucha is less than buying store bought kombucha.
I assume that kombucha can be created using the device that tastes equivalant or preferable to store purchased kombucha within about six months of open experimentation.

### drawing upon this scoring, describe which governance option, or combination of options, you would prioritize, and why. Outline any trade-offs you considered as well as assumptions and uncertainties
